A daughter, torn from this world too soon, cries out from beyond the grave for one last chance to see her beloved father, to hold him close and feel his warmth once more.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a self-motivated indie developer. I've been thinking about working on my first game since 2017. It's definitely not my first attempt, as I have tried and failed before... but I continue on.
